# Prototype `login` and `registration` system 

These functions are built for **Co-Working Space Software Engineering Project**

### Important things for forker/developers to remember:
* Run `git clone https://github.com/Purinat33/Login-Register-Prototyping` in a shell/terminal/PowerShell of your choices, make sure **git is installed on your system**.
* Run `cd` until you're at the **root** of the directory. Checked by running either `dir` or `ls` and confirming that `README.md` can be seen as output (This file will 100% and always will be at the **root** of our repository).

* Do not forget to create a file named `.env` at the **root** of the repository. The required contents are as followed:
```
DEV=true
SQLITE_DB=./model/database.db
```
*Note*: We have `.env` in place because of MySQL connection strings, these are used only during productions only.

* Run `git pull origin master` at the **root** of the repository in your command-line just in case if the repository got updated.
